20 INTRODUCTION

“conversations of this sort, resting on the authority of
men of earlier times and likewise renowned, seem tor
some reason to possess greater weight.” This conver-
sation is reported as having occurred soon after the death
of Scipio, 129 nc.

Time of composition. - The Laelius was written in
44 rac, probably in the month of June, after the 'Cato
Maior, to which it is a companion. 'The time was one
in which the first hopes for the restoration of the re-
public, formed at the death of Caesar, were turning into

disappointment; and the forebodings which Cicero puts
into the mouth of Laelius must be taken as the forecast
which he was making for the state in his own times. The
careful student cannot fail to see in many places, and
especially in the discussion of the effect of friendship on

political action, the references to Cicero's own times.
Sources. - The subject of friendship was one upon
which many Greek philosophers had written. Without
doubt Cicero was familiar with most, if not all, of their
writings, but imitatiops are infrequent. Correspondences
are noted between various parts of the Laelius and a
book of Theophrastus, περὶ petiam Xenophon's Memo-
¹rabilia, 2, 4-10, embodying a discourse of Socrates on
friendship; and Plato’s Theaetetus and Lysis. But as

has been said, the work is not of a character to have K

been drawn from Greek sources It is Cicero’s own
development of the subject, after reading the, Greek
authors, from his own observation, experience, and re-
flection.

Interlocutors in the Dialogus. —The chief speaker is
Gnrus LAELIUS, and secondary parts are given to
Q. Mucius seneroti and Gaws Fannius.

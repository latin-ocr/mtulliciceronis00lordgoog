(through his elder son) of the elder Scipio Africanus, and
the foremost man of his time. So early in life did he
make manifest his preeminent ability, that, in order to
give him the conduct of the third war against Carthage,
the laws were suspended to allow of his electiori as consul
before the legal age. At a later time he was elected con-
sul, without being a candidate, to complete the war against
Numantia. But, while excelling as a general, he stood
with Laelius in the front rank of the new Hellenic move-.
ment, and so devoted was he to the pursuit of these
studies, that he did not suffer his campaigns to interrupt

them, but, while engaged in them, took with him his friend ⁸

- the historiari Polybius, thatby constant intercourse with
him he might perfect his knowledge of Greek literature
and philosophy. Scipio, rather than Laelius was a typical
Roman. The austerity of his character was modified, but
not removed, by the refining influences of scholarship.
He was a member of the aristocratic party, and a strenu-
ous opponent, though a brother-in-law, of Tiberius Grac-
’ chus. In 129 nc, when political feeling ran high over
the execution of Gracchus’s agrarian law, Scipio was found
dead in his room on a morning following an excited debate
in the senate, but, though rumors were abundant, his
murderer was never known.

Chap. XXVII. Conclusion.

, 1-5· Cicero sends to Atticus a treatise on friendship, which, for
convenience' sake, he throws into the form of a dialogue‚ representing
it as a conversation received from Scaevola, who in turn said that he,
in company with Fannius, had it from Laelius, the friend of Scipio.

6-16. Fannius begins the conversation by saying that people,
having noted Laelius's absence from the last meeting of the augurs,
· wonder if it was from grief at the death of Scipio (6, 7). To Scaevola's
remark that he attributed Laelius's absence to ill health (8), laelius

replies that he is right, that public duty always should take precedence ¹

of private grief (8, 9), and that his sorrow is soothed by the recollection
of Scipio's glorious life and painless death (10-12), by the assurance of
his immortality and consequent wellssbeing(13,14),and by the precious
memories of their friendship (15). Laelius is then urged to discourse
on friendship (16).

17-25. Laelius asserts his inability to discuss the subject in any
but a practical way (17). Friendship can only exist between the good,
a term to be taken in its common meaning, and not as defined by the
philosophers (18, 19). lt consists in the absolute unanimity of desire
and feeling, rests upon virtue, and is better than all earthly advantages
(20, 21). The advantages of friendship and their universal recognition
(az—24). Laelius urged to proceed (²5) ,

26-32. Friendship is founded on affection, which is the work of
nature (26), as is seen by the fact that beasts love their offspring (27),
and that virtue is admired even in an enemy (28). Friendship is not
the result of reciprocal favors, though they may aid it (29, 30), or of a
desire for reward (31), or pleasure, as some philosophers wrongly
think (32).

33—35. Life-long friendships are rare, from political and other
disagreements, or from change of character with age (33). Marriage,
the desire for money or office (34), and the demand for an improper

' service, all tend to break friendship (35).

36-44. How far should a friend aid a friend? Examples of rnen
whose friends ought not to have aided them (36, 37). ln politics the
best Romans have AEways preferred patriotism to friendship (38, 39).

Friendship is no excuse for unworthy deeds (4ο). The prospects of
the state from the associations of evil men are bad (41)‚but‚if friends
are abandoned when they begin to do evil, the state can not be harmed
(42, 43). “ Honorable in all things '³ should be the rule of friendship,
with readiness to give and take advice ( ).

45-55. Some false views of friendship are combated3 that it
should not 66 too close for fear of anxiety (45); that it is sought for
assistance and relief (46). These views destroy friendship‚ as they do
virtue, for paih aud pleasure are inseparable in it (47), and freedom
from feeling is impossible (48). Friendship has utility, but it rests
on natural, kindly impulses (4o51). Possession of all things can not
give, or supply the place of, friendship, as tyrants learn ( 52-5 5).

5661. Three false views discussed‚ with a criticism of Scipio's
upon a remark of Bias (56-66). Slight departures from rectitude are
sometimes allowed (61).

62-66. The choice of friends. Care should be exercised in the
choice of friends (62), and these should not be hastily accepted (63).
The tests of friendship (64) and its rich qualities (65, 66).

67, 68. The relation of old friends and new.

69-75. The relations of superiors and inferiors (69-72). Pro-
priety is to 66 considered iu doing a service (73). The relations of
friends of mature life and those of youth (74). Infirmity of temper
should not interfere with the duties of friendship (75).

76·100. Friendships which bring disgrace should be broken (76),
but not so as to produce eumity (77, 78). Το prevent this, caution is
necessary in choosing friends (79, 80), and mere advantage must not
be sought (8ο, 81). Similarity and virtue make friends (82, 83), but
the judgment must be exercised before we love (84, 85). This, how· ¹
ever, is not commonly the case (86). Friendship is the natural law of
life, though we are very slow to recognize it (87-89)‚ for we are not able
to hear or to tell the truth without offense (89, 90). Flattery, the worst
foe to friendship‚ must be guarded against (91-96); but flattery only
hurts him who wishes to receive it, ancl is less injurious when open than
when covered (97-100).

roo-104. Virtue is the only basis and bond of friendship (100),

as Laelius found iu his own case (τοι). His intimacy with Scipio was
the greatest blessing of his lif . Virtue and friendship, therefore, are

to be placed above everythiug else (το2-το4).

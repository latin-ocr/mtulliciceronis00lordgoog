“Night and day,'’ said he, “I spent in the examination
of all branches of learning.” Such was his diligence and
power of acquisition that when, at the age of twenty-six,
he made his first public speech, the only quality of an
experienced orator which he lacked was familiarity with
'a large audience.

But intense application exhausted the slender physique
of the young orator, and in 79 he left Rome to regain his,
health. Going first to Athens, which, froin his love oi
Greek letters, was a hallowed spot, he spent a year in
the study of philosophy and rhetoric, then, passing on to ¹
Asia, studied rhetoric under various teacherS, but espess
cially under his old instructor, Molo of Rhodes. At the

end of two years he returned to Rome, renewed in health, ’

and with an improved literary and oratorical style. Much

advocate in abundance; and so popular did he become

κ that, without the aid of wealth or family influence, he was

elected quaestor in his thirty-first year— the first in which
he was eligible. His province was Lilybaeum, the western
partos Sicily, where he distinguished himself by a just
and righteous administration. So grateful was the remem-
, brance of his people that, on his return to Rome, they
besought him to conduct the impeachment of their extor-
tionate and tyrannical eir-governor, Gaius Verres Prose-
cutions were contrary to Cicero’s nature and principles—
in one other case only, that of T. Manutius Plancus, did he
appear as a prosecut0r; but the requests were so urgent
that he consented. ¹The result was the exile of Verres.

SKETCH OF CICERO 17

and united its strength to rhythm and melody; while his
writings form the richest partos Latin literature, and, as
Quintilian says, form the standard by which to test pro·
ficiency in Latin· Cicero was the leader ol the Hellenic

Χ culture of his time. He opened to his countrymen the
*χ fountains of Greek philosophy, diffusing a knowledge
*3 which before had been confined to a culturcd few, and
l¹ at the same time opening a new department in the use
l of the Latin language. He was not an original philoso-
pher, but he had a philosophie mind ot great power, and

0 loved philosophy forits own sake. It. was to its pursuit
that he turned in all the intervals of public activity, and to
find rest in weariness and consolation in sorrow '“With-

‘ out thee,'’ he says of philosophy in his latest years, “what
would my life have been? To thee do I come for refuge,
from thee do I implore aid, to thy hands do Ι commit
myself, as in my earlier life for the most part, so now
wholly and unreservedly. A single day within thy courts

is better than an immortality in the tents of wickedness.
Whose aid, then, shall I sooner enjoy than thine, who hast
given me tranquillity of lile and taken away the sear of
death? ” Α thorough acquaintance with the various-philo-
sophie systems of Greece enabled him not merely to trans-
late the works ol the Greeks, but to adapt and remodel
them for the more practical Romans. It was therefore,

a twofold debt that Rome owed Cicero, —the enlargement

of her literary lire, and the enriching of her language.
Without Cicero those great writers-Vergil, Horace, Livy,
and others whose works form the treasures of Latin liter·
ature, -would have been impossible, at least as we know
them. To the debt ol Rome to Cicero is to be added,

then, that ol the cultivated world.-

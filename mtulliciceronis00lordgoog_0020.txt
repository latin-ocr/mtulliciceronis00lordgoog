14 INJRODUCHON

This promise Cicero kept, but he could not actively sup

port Caesar, and from the close of the war in 47 to the
death of Caesar he, therefore, withdrew himself from poli-
tics‚ and tried to forget the loss of his country in literary
work. Within this period he wrote no less than eighteen
works: Hortensius, or De Plzilosoplzia,· Partitiones Ora-
toriae ,· Brutus, or De Claris Oratoribus ,· and Orator. ln
45 he lost his daughter Tullia, to whom he was'devotedly
attached. To assuage his grief, he read every treatise
of the philosophers on consolation, and wrote himself a
treatise,l *De Consolatione. It was followed by the Aca-
demica, a work on the new Academic philosophy; De ,
Finibus Bononiae et Malorum, a work on ethics; Disputa-
tiones Tusculanae, on happiness and morality; De Natura
Deorum, De Divinatione, De Fato, Cato Maior, or De
Senectute,· Laelius, or De Amicitia ,· Parodana, discussing
some Stoic propositions; Topica, a work written on a sea-
voyage‚ and from memory, in explanation of the Topics of
Aristotle; De Optimo Genera Dicendi, De Officiis, and *De
Gloria. Probably some others of his productions belong
to this period, as the *De Virtutibus, De Aieguriis, and

exclusively to them. They were the mature fruit of a life-
time of research and reflection. Some of them had been
begun before; others were the execution of plans which
had been long in mind, and for which preparation had
been made. But the fact that within that time they were
produced bya man who turned to their composition to find

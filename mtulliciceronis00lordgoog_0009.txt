Ι ΝΟΤΕ ΤΟ THE RlZVISED EDITION

-οοο-

ΤΗΕ text adopted for this work is that of Baiter and
Kayser. Any changes from the standard text are men-
tioned in the notes. ,

In preparing the notes, the aim has been to fumish
all explanations that seem necessary for the clear under-
¹standing of points of grammar, history, biography, and

’ ’ ancient customs. ln addition to this the attention of

the student has been called by translation, and remark
upon special passages, to the literary character of the
essay and· to the clear and happy development of
the subiect. The quantities of the long vowels have
been marked to aid the student in correct pronuncia-
tion, ior which the practice of reading aloud is recom-
mended.

Many editions have been consulted, but chief assistance
· has been received from those of Lahmeyer, Long, Nauck,

Α Reid, and Seyffert, for which credit is given in the notes

’ Ι also wish to express my thanks to the editors of the Ameri-
can Book Company for their suggestions and assistance.

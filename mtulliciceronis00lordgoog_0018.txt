recall of Cicero It ought to have convinced him that it
was useless to talk of Curius and Fabricius in a state in
which patriotism had been exchanged for seli-seeking, and
statesmanship for the arts of the demagogue.

Cicero's return was like a triumphal procession. Not·
withstanding his haste to see Rome, such crowds ol friends
from all the towns delayed his journey, that he was twenty-
four days in passing from Brundisium to Rome. When
there, aristocracy and plebeians vied with each other to
give him welcome. But his enemies were still lively and
strong. “My condition,” wrote he to Atticus, “is lor

prosperity slippery, for adversity· good.'' He therefore
⁵ withdrew‚ as far as possible, from public life, and while
still being the foremost advocate in the forum, and the
most eloquent speaker and the wisest counselor in the
senate, and still keeping all his interest in the welfare of
the state, betbok himself more and more to the enjoyment
of literary studies and composition. In the years that in-
tervened between his return from exile and proconsulate
he wrote the De Oratore, De Re Publica, and De Legibus.
ι His productioris were not as numerous as at a later time,
’ for his work was still mainly one of preparation. He was
“devouring literature,'’ and giving himself “unreservedly ⁶
to the lile most in accordance with nature, that of the
student.'’

ln 51, by the revival of a law that no consul should
. enter upon a provincial government before live years from
the close ol his consulship, the ex-consuls of more than live
years' standing were compelled to draw lots for the vacant
provinces. Greatly to his disgust, Cicero drew the prov-
ince of Cilicia. The only satisfaction which his govern-
ment gave him was the opportunity to revisit Athens.

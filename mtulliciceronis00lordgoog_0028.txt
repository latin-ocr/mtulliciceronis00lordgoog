of the new literary impulse. The poet Terence was his
friend, the purity of whose Latinity was ascribed by many
of that day to the revision of Laelius. The style of Lae-

· and archaic, was in general noted forits smoothness His
daughter Laelia, who married Q. Mucius Scaevola, was

. the most cultivated woman of her day, and her conversa-

Laelius is always mentioned by Cicero in the highest
terms as gentle, upright, and seli-controlled. He is in-

Q. Muc1us SCAEVOLA, the son-in-law ol LaeliuS, be-
longed to a family in which Cicero says the knowledge
of civil law had become almost an heirloom, and was him-
self a lawyer of great learning and experience. Cicero,
who always speaks oi him in terms of warmest praise,
studied law under his instruction. He was praetor 121

of augur. He was born 157, and died not later than
86 ae. Cicero introduces him as an interlocutor in the
' De Oratqre and De Republica.

Gmus FANNIUS, also a son-in-law of Laelius, had little
prominence in the state, but had some distinction as a man
ol letters and an author. He wrote a history, not now .
extant, which Cicero mentions with the faint praise that
it was written in a style not destitute of grace. He also
appears in the De Republica. ’

Puomus Coqumus Sermo Aanrnmuus though not an
interlocutor in the dialogue, yet deserves mention as the
one whose opinions are ostensibly presented. He was the
son oi L. Paulus Aemilius the grandson by adoption

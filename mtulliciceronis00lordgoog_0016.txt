degree. His support of a measure was taken as a guaran-
tee that it was in accord with the spirit of the past, and his
open opposition was difficult to withstand. When, there-
fore, crafty men —notably thegreat triumvirate, Caesar,
Crassus, and Pompey, who by their union became the strong-
est force in the state-began to lay masked schemes for
their own aggrandizement, they found it necessary for their
full success to draw Cicero to their side. The triumvirate
tried to win him by offers of various responsible positions, 5
but, finding they could make no impression upon him, deter-
mined to remove him from the eity— not openly, but by
leaving him to the mallee of personal enemies. ¹
There was a'profligate young noble, Clodius by name,
who had become incensed against Cicero because he had,
testihed against him when aeeused of sacrilege. Having

been adopted into a plebeian family, he was elected tribune, · ³
and proceeded at onec to take measures to have Cicero ban· ’

ished from the city. His charge against Cicero was the old
one of illegal execution of· Roman citizens. In March of 58
he was successful, and Cicero was interdieted from fire and
water—tle, banished on pain of death-within a distance
of five hundred miles from Rome. This result was reached
. by the secret aid of 'the triumvirate, or at least by their
acquiescenee. From Caesar Cicero had little to expect;
but from Pompey, who owed his greatness in no small de-
gree to the eloquenee of Cicero, and who, since his return
from the East, had more than once been aided by the friend-
ship and the advocacy of the great orator, he had a right
to expect assistance. But regard for favors received and
the elaims of friendship weighed little against the prompt-
ings of a selhsh politieal purpose, and Pompey, with base
¹ ingratitude‚ withdrew and left him naked to his enemies

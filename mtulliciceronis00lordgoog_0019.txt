His administration was wise and mercilul; and in those

, dayS, when provincial governments were sought almost

wholly lor the opportunities they afforded their fortunate
possessors to enrich themselves it was a rare thing for one
to care more lor the interest of his subjects and the de-
mands of ¹justice than the establishment ol his own fortunes
He left his province at the expiration ol a year, accom-
panied hythe blessing, and not, as was usually the ease,
the curses, of those over whom he ruled. He returned to
Rome early in 49 to find himself in “the flames ol civil

war.” Caesar and Pompey, whose alliance, interrupted ⁶

by the death ol Crassus in 53, had turned into a bitter
rivalry lor the supreme power, which,‘lrom the tottering
state ol the government, would plainly be the prize ol · the
stronger, had made their appeal to the sword. The state
ol affairs was what Cicero had long loreseen, but he was
not prepared to meet it. He knew not what to do. He
could not join with either party in a war with Roman citi-
zens, neither could he remain neutral. He had never
been drawn toward Caesar ; and Pompey, with whom were
all his affiliations, disgusted him with his arrogant seli-
assurance and weakness. After long uncertainty, he
joined the cause ol Pompey3 but his tempest-tossed spirit
was never satisfied, and his allegiance was ol little value.
The conductos the civil war, and Cicero's part in it, are to
be learned from the histories ol the times, and the special
lives ol Cicero. It is enough to say that, aiter Pharsalia,
Cicero recognized the ultimate triumph ol Caesar as in-
evitable, and, returning to Italy, awaited the pleasure ol
the conqueror. This proved to be that he should no
longer oppose Caesar-a promise which he was ready
to make.
